			<div class="mob-whole six columns left">
			 The discipline of medicinal chemistry is concerned with the discovery and development of novel agents for the treatment of diseases. The majority of this activity is focused on developing novel natural or synthetic organic chemicals. It discusses many aspects of organic medicinals, including how they are discovered, how they work, and how they became clinical agents. The process of developing a new pharmaceutical is extremely complicated,

			requiring the skills of experts from numerous disciplines such as chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, pharmaceutics, and medicine. Medicinal chemistry is primarily concerned with the organic, analytical, and biochemical elements of this process, but the chemist must collaborate constructively with experts from other disciplines. Thus,  medicinal chemistry holds an important place at the intersection of chemistry and biology.

	         <p> Chemical substances used to prevent or treat diseases in humans, animals, and plants are referred to as drugs. The pharmaceutical effect of a drug on the subject is defined as its activity. Since drugs act by interfering with biological processes, no drug is absolutely safe for use especially in high doses. <br>
Therefore, constant drug discovery and development, in addition to proper use of medicines are needed not only to combat drug resistance, but also to improve the treatment of existing and newly discovered diseases, and the development of safer medicines by reducing or eliminating negative side effects.

      		<h3>Drug metabolism Highlights</h3>	

	      	<ul>
			<li>Lipophilic antibiotics, or xenobiotics, would stay in the body indefinitely if they were not metabolized to polar, easily excretable water-soluble compounds. Hence, the formation of water-soluble metabolites not only improves drug elimination, but also results in substances that are usually pharmacologically inert and nontoxic.</li>
			<li>Many medications undergo biotransformation to produce pharmacologically active metabolites. These metabolites can have important activity that contributes significantly to the parent drug's pharmacological or toxicological effect(s). When administered, the parent compound can be inactive and must be metabolically transformed to a biologically active drug, compounds known as prodrugs.</li>
			<li>Drug metabolism can result in detoxification or bioactivation of drugs. The detoxification process entails two stages of drug metabolism: In Phase I reactions, lipophilic drugs are converted into more polar molecules by adding or unmasking a polar functional group, such as –OH or –NH2.</li>
			<li>Reduction, oxidation, or hydrolysis are commonly involved in phase I reactions. In Phase I metabolism, pharmacologic activity may increase, decrease, or have no effect. Whereas, Phase II involves conjugation reactions, where the kidneys will excrete metabolites from phase I metabolism if they are sufficiently polar.</li>
		</ul>

      	<div class="mob-whole six columns right">

	      	<h3>SAR Highlights</h3>

	      	<ul>
				<li>In the development of safe and effective drugs, a thorough understanding of the Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) which connects the structural features of a molecule to a property, effect, or biological activity correlated with that chemical is important. </li>
				<li>Knowledge and understanding of SAR will enable pharmacists along with professionals from various fields of sciences to grasp the fundamental concept that the structure and physiochemical properties of a chemical implicitly influences its physical and chemical properties as well as its reactivities, which in turn specify its toxicological properties as it interacts with a biological system. </li>
				<li>The determination and identification of toxicological properties of a chemical will then lead to structural modification of a molecule, and that alterations in the structure will produce changes in its biologic action and activity thereby influencing the development of safer and effective drugs.</li>

      	<div class="mob-whole six columns left">

	      	<h3>Physiochemical Properties of Drugs Highlights</h3>	

	      	<ul>
				<li>The capability of a chemical compound to elicit a pharmacological/therapeutic action is connected to the influence of the chemical substance's varied physical and chemical (physicochemical) qualities on the bio molecule with which it interacts.</li>
				<li>Ionization of Drug, Solubility, Partition Coefficient, Hydrogen Bonding, Protein Binding, Chelation, Bioisosterism, Geometrical and Optical Isomerism are some of the Physico-Chemical Properties of drugs.</li>
				<li>The physicochemical properties of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) or an excipient can impact the formulation and performance of a dosage form, independently of its type or route of administration.</li>
				<li>The physicochemical properties of prospective therapeutic molecules are at the forefront of current thought and practice in medicinal chemistry, and they are essential quality indicators that have been shown to influence attrition.</li>
				<li>In drug discovery, physicochemical properties are the tangible physical attributes of molecules that are associated to interactions with various media and environments. The interconnected qualities of lipophilicity (partition and distribution coefficients), solubility, and pKa are the most relevant parameters in drug development in this context.</li>
				<li>Indeed, the core of medicinal chemistry is discovering a compromise amidst these conflicting requirements to identify compounds with ideal characteristics to deliver suitable activities, pharmacokinetic exposures, and pharmacodynamic responses, while limiting off-target activity or toxicity.</li>

      	<div class="mob-whole six columns right">

	      	<h3>Antimicrobials Highlights</h3>

			 <ul>
				<li>The term antimicrobial comes from the Greek words anti (against), mikros (little), and bios (life) and pertains to all substances that fight against microbial organisms.</li>
				<li>Antimicrobials are any agents that work against microorganisms of any sort, including bacteria (antibacterial), viruses (antiviral), fungus (antifungal), and protozoa (antiprotozoal).</li>
				<li>This is not the same as antibiotics, a related phrase derived from the Greek words anti (against) and biotikos (life) (concerning life). Antibiotics, by definition, are chemicals produced by microorganisms that fight against another microorganism.</li>
				<li>Antibiotics are all antimicrobials, but not all antimicrobials are antibiotics.</li>
				<li>Antimicrobials are classified in various ways, including spectrum of activity (broad-spectrum, intermediate-spectrum, or narrow- spectrum), bacterial effect (bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic), and mode of action (inhibition of cell wall synthesis, inhibition of cell membrane function, inhibition of protein synthesis, inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis and inhibition of other metabolic processes).</li>

	             <h5>As a Clinical Pharmacist</h5>
		     <h3>Significance of knowing the process of drug metabolism and the different metabolic pathways of drugs.</h3>

	               <p> Deep understanding and familiarity with drug metabolism processes and different metabolic pathways will help me, as a clinical pharmacist to predict the effects of drug–drug interactions, drug–food interactions, and herbal drug–drug interactions, as well as clarify patients' adverse reactions to drug regimens. The understanding and knowledge I have of drug metabolism mechanisms and different metabolic pathways will enable me to be better, if not best in selecting the appropriate medication regimens prior to the start of therapy of the patient. As such, incorporating pharmacogenomics into drug regimen selection will improve the way medicines are prescribed to patients. Selection based on a patient's unique genetic make-up may remove previously unpredictable drug-treatment responses triggered by genetic polymorphisms that affect metabolism, clearance, and tolerance. As well as pharmacogenomic testing to assess a patient's phenotype like having a poor metabolizer, and thereby the patient's capacity to metabolize drugs may become more common. </br>

			<h5> As a Lormanian Pharmacy Student</h5>
			<h3>Concerete ways in which I can help solve issues in Antimicrobial Resistance</h3>
						
	               <p>As a BS Pharmacy student, an initial step that I can take in order for me to be able to tackle the issue of antimicrobial resistance is through educating oneself. Education is vital— the education of future and healthcare professionals and, subsequently, the education of patients.  With my voice, I could create an avalanche of antimicrobial drug awareness, and as early as now, start sharing some schemes for the battle against drug resistance.  Because the most prevalent cause of resistance is the abuse of antimicrobial drugs, patients must take their antibiotics in the precise way in which they are prescribed, it is important that health care practitioners reinforce this to patients and do better work in explaining precisely how the drugs should be taken. But of course, just knowing without action is useless. As a student, for now, I could volunteer to be a part of a trusted and authentic organization which is a source of all knowledge, strategies and well thought-of projects and use social media as a platform to rapidly reach a wider audience effectively. </br>

			<h5> As a Lormanian Pharmacy student </h5>
			<h3> Importance of being knowledgeable in the synthesis of drugs</h3>
						
	               <p>
	                As a pharmacy student, acquiring knowledge on drug synthesis is important despite the availability of drugs in the market because not only does being well-versed makes me aware of the accurate doses of the drugs that should be administered based on its known variable amount of active constituents, but being knowledgeable on drug synthesis also enables me to eliminate the toxic effects of the drug source due to its impurities and use only its therapeutically active ingredients. Lastly, this equipped knowledge will allow me to be able to perform and apply skills in the laboratory synthesis of various compounds and subsequently  contribute in the development of new valuable drugs.
